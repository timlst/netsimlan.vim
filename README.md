# NetSimLan Syntax Highlighting for vim 

Syntax Highlighting for the [NetSimLan Programming Language](https://netsimlan.org/) in the vim text editor 

## Description

This plugin adds basic syntax highlighting functionality to the NetSimLan Programming Language developed at the [SFB901](https://sfb901.uni-paderborn.de/de/) at the University of Paderborn.

I made this for my lecture "Verteilte Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen" held by Prof. Dr. Christian Scheideler in the summer term 2021.

The main goal is to provide basic comfort, it does not aim to provide a fullfledged experience that fully incorporates all of NetSimLan's features.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Works under Vim 8.2, but afaik there shouldn't be any compatability issues with earlier versions

### Installing

This should be compatible with Pathogen and all basic vim plugin managers that match include its functionality.
NetSimLan does not provide any file type by default, so _nsl_ and _nslc_ files are highlighted.
